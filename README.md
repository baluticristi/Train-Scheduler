This is our Database Applications project.

A train scheduler app is a type of application that is used to manage and organize train schedules. This type of app typically provides users with information about train schedules and arrivals, and allows users to plan and book train trips.

The app has a user interface that displays a list of trains and their schedules, along with information about destinations, departure times, and other details. The app does also include features such as the ability to search for trains, view train routes on a map, and book tickets.

The presentation of the app, is in the Presentation.docx document.
